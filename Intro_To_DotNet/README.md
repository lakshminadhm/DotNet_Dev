# What is .NET?

.NET is a free and open-source development framework by Microsoft that you can use to build different kinds of applications. It's cross-platform, meaning you can run it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

With .Net, you can create variety of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, gaming, cloud, IoT, and machine learning solutions.

Originally introduced in 2002, .NET has evolved significantly over the years. It now includes .NET Core, which enables cross-platform development, and .NET 5 and later versions, which unify the ecosystem. The evolution of .NET has brought about improvements in performance, security, and developer productivity, making it a robust and modern framework for building a wide range of applications.

# Key Features of .NET

.NET is packed with features that make development easier and more efficient. Here are some of the most important ones:

**1. Cross-Platform Compatibility**

With **.NET Core** (now merged into .NET 5+), developers can build and run applications on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, making it a truly cross-platform framework.

**2. Multiple Language Support**

.NET supports multiple programming languages, including:  
- **C#** – The most widely used and preferred language in .NET development.  
- **F#** – A functional-first programming language.  
- **VB.NET** – An object-oriented language for .NET development.

**3. High Performance & Scalability**

The latest versions of .NET, including **.NET 6 and .NET 7**, are optimized for high performance, making them faster than traditional frameworks. It is also highly scalable, making it suitable for enterprise applications.

**4. Open-Source & Strong Community Support**

Since 2016, .NET has been open-source under the **.NET Foundation**, making it freely available and supported by a large developer community worldwide.

**5. Unified Framework**

With the release of **.NET 5**, Microsoft unified the different versions of .NET (.NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin) into a single platform.

**6. Integrated Security**

.NET provides built-in security features like **authentication, authorization, encryption**, and **secure coding practices** to help developers build robust applications.

# Components of .NET

## Core Components

-  **.NET Runtime: The Execution Engine**

	The .NET Runtime, also known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), is responsible for executing .NET applications. It provides services such as memory management, execution flow control, exception handling, garbage collection, and performance optimization, ensuring efficient and secure code execution. It features Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which converts Intermediate Language (IL) into machine code at runtime, and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, which improves startup performance by pre-compiling code before execution.

-  **Base Class Library (BCL): Pre-Built Functionalities**

	The Base Class Library (BCL) is a comprehensive collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide fundamental functionalities for file I/O, networking, data handling, cryptography, and security. It also supports asynchronous programming through System.Threading.Tasks, enabling efficient concurrency. The BCL serves as the foundation for .NET applications, offering essential utilities for developers without requiring manual implementation of common functionalities.
-  **.NET Compiler & Language Support**
	
	The .NET Compiler translates source code into Intermediate Language (IL), which is then executed by the runtime. It includes Roslyn, the compiler for C# and VB.NET, which provides real-time code analysis, refactoring, and optimization. The F# compiler supports functional programming paradigms, making it ideal for data analysis and scientific computing. Source Generators enable automatic code generation at compile time, reducing manual effort and improving performance. Other features like nullable reference types, reflection, and generic programming enhance type safety, flexibility, and efficiency. The compiler ensures that the code is correctly translated into IL, which the CLR can execute efficiently.
	
## Higher Level Components

-  **.NET SDK & Developer Tools**

	The .NET Software Development Kit (SDK) provides essential tools and libraries for building, running, testing, and deploying .NET applications. It includes the .NET CLI (Command-Line Interface), which allows developers to create, build, and run applications using commands like dotnet new, dotnet build, and dotnet run. The NuGet Package Manager simplifies dependency management by integrating third-party and Microsoft-maintained libraries. MSBuild automates project compilation and builds, while Hot Reload enables real-time code updates without restarting the application. The SDK also integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.

-  **Application Frameworks (App Stacks) in .NET**

    .NET offers various application frameworks, each designed for specific types of applications. These app stacks build on and take advantage of low-level libraries, language, and runtime, defining the way that apps are constructed and their lifecycle of execution.
    - **ASP.NET Core** – A high-performance framework for web applications and REST APIs.
    - **Windows Forms (WinForms) & Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** – Used for desktop applications with rich UI capabilities.
    - **Blazor** – Enables developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, supporting both WebAssembly and server-side rendering.
    - **Minimal APIs & gRPC** – Optimized for microservices and high-performance inter-service communication.
    - **ML.NET** – Integrates machine learning capabilities into .NET applications.
    - **.NET MAUI** – A modern framework for cross-platform mobile and desktop application development, replacing Xamarin.

    These frameworks provide pre-built components, tools, and optimizations, making application development more efficient and scalable.

# .NET ecosystem

The **.NET ecosystem** consists of multiple variants, each designed to support different types of applications. This diversity is due to both **historical** and **technical** reasons.

.NET started in the early 2000s with the **.NET Framework**, which was designed primarily for Windows applications. However, as technology evolved, there was a need for cross-platform development and specialized runtime environments, leading to the emergence of other .NET variants.

Different application types require different features, performance optimizations, and platform compatibility. To address these needs, multiple versions of .NET were developed.

There are four .NET implementations that Microsoft supports:
- .NET Framework (Windows-only, Legacy)

    The original version of .NET, introduced in 2002, designed for Windows applications. Supports WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET Web Forms, and ASP.NET MVC. No longer actively developed but still maintained. Recommended to migrate to .NET (formerly .NET Core).

- .NET (.NET 5 and later versions)

    A modern, cross-platform, open-source implementation of .NET, introduced in 2016. Supports applications across Windows, Linux, and macOS, including web, cloud, desktop, and microservices. Starting from .NET 5, the platform was unified under the ".NET" name. Actively developed, with the latest version being .NET 8. Recommended for all new .NET development due to improved performance, flexibility, and long-term support.

- Mono

    An open-source implementation of the .NET runtime, initially developed to run .NET applications on non-Windows platforms like Linux, macOS, and mobile. Plays a key role in Xamarin, enabling .NET applications on iOS and Android. Widely used in game development through Unity. With .NET unification, many of Mono’s features are now integrated into .NET, but it remains relevant for specific use cases such as embedded systems and legacy Xamarin applications.

- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) (Windows-only)

    A Windows-specific implementation of .NET designed for creating modern Windows applications that run on desktops, tablets, Xbox, HoloLens, and IoT devices. It uses a subset of the Windows API and is optimized for touch, stylus, and other modern input methods. While UWP is still supported, Microsoft is shifting focus toward WinUI 3 and .NET MAUI for future Windows app development.
